## papyrus.cs
Papyrus is a tool to render Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (from now on referenced as "MCBE") worlds using Leaflet. It is written in C# and powered by .NET Core 2.2.
It currently runs only under windows, but support for linux is planned.

You can view an example [here](http://gwsa.de/minecraft/map.html).

## Introduction
Since MCBE worlds don't use the Anvil format like in the Java Edition, but rather a by Mojang [modified version](https://github.com/Mojang/leveldb-mcpe) of Google's [LevelDB](http://leveldb.org/) to save, the goal of Papyrus is to read these worlds and assemble a render of every pre-generated chunk.

## Features
- Render a top-down map of every already explored chunk
- Windows and Linux Support

#### Planned

- Nether/ The End support
- Isometric renders
- Auto-Updating renders

## Installation
Just unpack the zip-file.

Requires .NET Core 2.2. You may need to install [additional dependencies](https://github.com/mjungnickel18/papyruscs#additional-dependencies).

Otherwise, just grab one of the [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/mjungnickel18/papyruscs/releases).

## Usage
```papyrus --world "My World/db" --output "C:\papyrus"```

  -o, --output      (Default: .) Sets the output path for the generated map tiles

  -s, --strategy    (Default: ParallelFor) Sets the render strategy. Valid are SingleFor and ParallelFor (Multithreaded)
