## papyrus.cs
Papyrus is a tool to render Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (from now on referenced as "MCBE") worlds using Leaflet. It is written in C# and powered by .NET Core 2.2.
It currently runs only under windows, but support for linux is planned.

You can view an example [here](http://papyrus.gwsa.de/).

## Introduction
Since MCBE worlds don't use the Anvil format like in the Java Edition, but rather a by Mojang [modified version](https://github.com/Mojang/leveldb-mcpe) of Google's [LevelDB](http://leveldb.org/) to save, the goal of Papyrus is to read these worlds and assemble a render of every pre-generated chunk.

## Features
- Render a top-down map of every already explored chunk
- Windows and Linux Support

#### Planned

- Nether/ The End support
- Isometric renders
- Auto-Updating renders

## Installation
Otherwise, just grab one of the [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/mjungnickel18/papyruscs/releases).
Just unpack the zip-file.

### Linux
Make sure that your graphics libs are up-to-date: (Syntax may vary in other distros) 
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libgdiplus
sudo apt-get install llibc6-dev
```

And give PapyrusCs execution rights:
```chmod +x PapyrusCs```

For own compilation:
Requires [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2). You may need to install [additional dependencies](https://github.com/mjungnickel18/papyruscs#additional-dependencies).


## Usage
For Linux: give the extracted PapyrusCs file execution rights! See installation notes above. 

```papyruscs --world "My World/db" --output "C:\papyrus"```

```
  -w, --world       Required. Sets the path the Minecraft Bedrock Edition Map
  -o, --output      (Default: .) Sets the output path for the generated map 
                    tiles
  --htmlfile        (Default: map.html) Sets name of html map file
  -s, --strategy    (Default: ParallelFor) Sets the render strategy. Valid are 
                    SingleFor and ParallelFor (Multithreaded)
  --coords          (Default: true) Render text coordinates in each chunk
  --limitx          Limits the chunk rendering in the x dimension (inclusive). 
                    Provide two values with comma separated, eg: -10,10
  --limitz          Limits the chunk rendering in the z dimension (inclusive). 
                    Provide two values with comma separated, eg: -10,10
  --threads         (Default: 16) Set maximum of used threads
  --help            Display this help screen.
  --version         Display version information.
```
